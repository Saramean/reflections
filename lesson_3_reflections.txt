When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am co-working with other co-workers, by sharing code in GitHub, managing
   and collaborating codes to update will be much easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Well, I am not sure. Because, even though we pull all the updates from the GitHub
   , we have all the log and can still access older version like before we pull.
   May be, it's because of letting the users to choose whether it need to be update
   or not after they look up the commit to update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    The fork is used to get another people's repositories in Github to my Github.
  And the clone is used to get those repositories to my local stroge.
  And the branch is used when we want to add new feature in our program but when
  we want to keep our original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Even if we changed some files in locally, by storing last known state of the
  remote, we can keep all the collating up-to-date

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

     Working different part of code and merging will be far easier. 
    But for a person using version control first, it could be hard to accustom.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

     When I am not sure the changes I made would be agreed by my co-worker.
    Especially when I suggest some features, but it need to be discussed with
    other co-workers, we can get some benefits from using branches.
